# Adding a new translation

1. Copy `en.properties` to a new translation file.
2. Edit the file as needed.
  * If you're not translating a given key, skip it. `en.properties` will automatically be used to fill in the blanks.
  * Only lines starting with "#" are comments. An "#" in the middle of a line is not treated as a comment.
  * Don't be afraid to use Unicode characters! Encode your file using UTF-8.
3. Make a pull request. The developers will handle the rest.
