## Lists and files

After successfully launching swanshell, the first screen displayed is the *file browser* view.

This view is the primary method of interacting with data on the nileswan's storage card:

- The top bar shows the current directory path being browsed. As swanshell starts browsing at the card's root directory, `/` is the directory displayed.
- The bottom bar shows the current page and total number of pages. The contents of larger directories may span multiple pages, which can be navigated between using the `X4` and `X2` buttons. swanshell supports displaying slightly over 1500 files per directory.
- The middle area shows the files on the current page of the current directory. You can use `X1` and `X3` to navigate between the files.

The following buttons are used in all swanshell list views:

- The `X` pad (`X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `X4`) is used to navigate the contents of the list. Other lists (such as the settings menu) work the same way!
- `A` is used to select an option. For example, in the file browser, `A` may enter a subdirectory, or launch a `.wsc` file.
- `B` is used to navigate upwards. For example, in the file browser, `B` will exit a previously entered subdirectory.

Some views may have additional features. For example, pressing `START` in the file browser brings up a menu with additional actions:

Alternatively, in the settings menu, `Y1` can be used to invoke further information about a specific option.
